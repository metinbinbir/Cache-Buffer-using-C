# Cache-Buffer-using-C
Simple cache buffer design with double linked list data structure using C programming language.

  <b>a.  Input</b> <br>
  
   Input the pages as a string (ABC,ABE,BCD,...) <br>
   Pages also can be able to read from file line by line.<br><br>
    
  <b>b.  Process</b><br>
  
   If the word is not in cache buffer, create a new node, make it head node and make it's counter 1.<br>
   If the word is in cache buffer, it's counter will be increased by 1, if the counter of that node is greater than the limit, it will be made head node.<br><br>
  
  <b>c.  Control</b><br>

   The cache buffer has a capacity. If there is an exceed on that capacity, last node of the cache buffer must be deleted.<br><br>
  <b>d.  Printing </b><br>
    
   The cache buffer must be showed in command prompt after every process.<br>
   After every printing process, the program asks to user for deleting all cache buffer.<br><br>
  
  <b>e.  Deletion</b><br>
  
   After every printing process, the program asks to user for deleting all cache buffer.
